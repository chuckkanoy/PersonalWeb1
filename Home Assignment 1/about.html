			<p><b>Major:</b> Computer Science</p>
			<p><b>Bio:</b> Hello! My name is Charles Kanoy, but I tend to go by Chuck.
				I have a fondness for computers and am extremely curious about them. Other things I
				occupy my time with include but are not limited to origami, reading, improvisational comedy,
				and writing. Once upon a time, I enjoyed making videos, and that is something I think
				I may try to get back into because "movie magic" fascinates me. I hope to become a software
				developer and/or web developer as my day job in the future because the idea of just sitting
				down with a computer and coming up with a product is both satisfying and interesting to me.
				In addition to this goal, I also want to publish at least one book within my lifetime, as that
				has been a dream of mine ever since I was a kid.</p>
